The search function will allow users to search for a specific polymer name    1. The system shall search for final polymer by full scientific name    2. The system shall initiate an asynchronous database query for the polymer    3. The query will retrieve information (ID, Quantity, Inventory) and create a recipe tree from the “start” (the searched object) to the “end” (initial raw materials)2. The user interface handler will allow users to view the recipe tree in a graphical format    1. The interface will construct a graphical node displaying the icon of each ingredient    2. The interface will display an Element ID (name) and amount for each node    3. The interface will connect each node to its predecessors and children with the appropriate inventory    4. Tapping a node on the recipe tree will display detailed information about the specific element    5. Dragging on the recipe tree will allow traversal along the sequential inventory steps for the desired element 3. The Database API will be constructed from a subset of tabular data from Polycraft    1. The Database will reflect actual items from Polycraft    2. The Database will contain formulas for crafting items using the different inventories    3. The API can pass item ID, item quantities, and inventories used to derive child or parent nodes    4. The API, given an item ID, can return inventory and quantity     5. The API, given an item ID, can return an icon representing the item in-game.    6. The API, given an item ID, can return item details (frequency of occurrence, typical locations, etc.)    7. The Database API can be given a new tabular data file to update itself## Use Case Diagram ##
